 A testable architecture enables fast and reliable tests
 that are easy to write, execute and maintain.
 
 Feature-coupled step definitions are step definitions
 that can’t be reused across features or scenarios.
 
 This may lead to an explosion of step definitions,
 code duplication, and high maintenance costs.
 
 How to decouple steps & step definitions

  Organise your steps by domain concept.
  Use domain-related names (rather than feature- 
  or scenario-related names) for your step & step definition files.
  
 Don’t use steps that combine a bunch of different things.
 This makes steps too specialised, and hard to reuse.
 Cucumber has built-in support for conjunctions
 (And, But) for a reason!
