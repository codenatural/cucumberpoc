Feature: Is it Friday yet?
  Everybody wants to know when it's Friday

  Scenario: Sunday isn't Friday
    Given today is Sunday
    When I ask whether it's Friday yet
    Then I should be told "Nope"
    
The first line of this file starts with the keyword Feature: followed by a name. It’s a good idea to use a name similar to the file name.

The second line is a brief description of the feature. Cucumber does not execute this line because it’s documentation.

The fourth line, Scenario: Sunday is not Friday is a scenario, which is a concrete example illustrating how the software should behave.

The last three lines starting with Given, When and Then are the steps of our scenario. This is what Cucumber will execute.

Scenario Outline - This is used to run the same scenario for 2
or more different sets of test data. 
E.g. In our scenario, if you want to register another user
you can data drive the same scenario twice.

Examples - All scenario outlines have to be followed with the Examples section.
This contains the data that has to be passed on to the scenario.


Scenario Outline:

    This uses Example keyword to define the test data for the Scenario
    This works for the whole test
    Cucumber automatically run the complete test the number of times equal to the number of data in the Test Set
    
Data Table:
Test Data:

    No keyword is used to define the test data
    This works only for the single step, below which it is defined
    A separate code needs to understand the test data and then it can be run single or multiple times but again just for the single step, not for the complete test
